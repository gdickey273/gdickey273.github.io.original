# gdickey273.github.io

A site dedicated to sharing with the user who I am and what I can do when it comes to coding. The site utilizes three pages: index.html (the landing page including an about me section), portfolio.html (containing links to several coding projects hosted on github), and contact.html (includes a form through which a user can submit their name, email, and message). 

## Styling

Each page utilizes an Eric Meyer reset.css and a parent style.css stylesheet. portfolio.html and contact.html both have additional stylesheets for styles specific to those pages. 

## Responsiveness
Each page in this site is designed to respond to a variety of viewports from a standard computer monitor to a small smartphone.
